title: Python functionalities everyone should use more

Some notes on a few slightly quirky features of python that I (and everyone) ought to take note of.

## 1. List comprehensions

These are fairly well known, but still don't seem to be used as often as they could be. Users of older versions often prefer the use of `map` or `filter`, but a list comprehension helps keep things to one line while retaining natural ordering.

A simple example of a list comprehension is 

{% highlight python %}
print([ i for i in range(10) ]) 
{% endhighlight %}

which generates the list output

{% highlight console %}
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
{% endhighlight %}

This is similar to the for loop

{% highlight python %}
_ = []
for i in range(10):
    _.append(i)
print(_)  
{% endhighlight %}

We are by no means limited to a simple identity mapping

{% highlight python %}
print([ i**i for i in range(10) ]) 

[1, 1, 4, 27, 256, 3125, 46656, 823543, 16777216, 387420489]
{% endhighlight %}


## function decorators

Consider the code snipet

{% highlight python %}

def print_name(func):
    def new_func(*args,**kwargs):
       	print(func.__name__)
	func(*args,**kwargs)
    return new_func
	
@print_name
def print_list(n):
    print([i for i in range(n)])

print_list(5)
{% endhighlight %}

This outputs the following:

{% highlight console %}
print_list
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
{% endhighlight %}

Effectively the line beginning with @ causes the function `print_list` to be replaced with `print_name(print_list)`. Decorators have a number of uses: Firstly they allow clean code by "redefining" function names on the line before they are created, rather than at the bottom of (potentially) long code Secondly, and more practically for logging, profiling or debugging purposes.

## the with statement

To (mis)-quote from the original [PEP343]("https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/")
 the python code snippet

{% highlight python %}
with foo as bar
	print(bar())
{% endhighlight %}

translates as something like

{% highlight python %}
_ = (foo)
bar = type(_).__enter__(_)
flag = True
try:
	try:
		print(bar())
	except:
		flag = False
		if not type(_).__exit__(_, *sys.exc_info()):):
			raise
	finally:
		if flag:
			type(_).__exit__(_, None, None, None)
{% endhighlight %}

This rather dense block of logic efficiently wraps a lot of convenient library operations in which an object is created and then destroyed. For example, the new, sexy way of openning files:

{% highlight python %}

with open("myfile.txt" as f"
	print(f.read())
{% endhighlight %}

This automagically deals with closing the file at the moment we leave the indented block, which is exactly when it should pass out of scope.
