title: Turn off the ParaView splah screen
---

One feature not everyone realises is available in ParaView is the ability to diable the annoying splash screen which is shown whenever the program boots. This used to be readily visible from the first options tab on the Preferences menu, but now it's hidden as an "advanced" option. To use it, make them visible, then deselect the option "Show Splash Screen" and apply your changes. All done
