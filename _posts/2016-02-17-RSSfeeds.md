title    : Adding an RSS feed to your Github pages website
---

With their usual small fanfare, github have added the ability to automatically generate an RSS feed of your recent posts to the gem plugins they have available. To use it, add the lines:

{% highlight bash %}
gems:
  - jekyll-feed
{% endhighlight %}

then set up a link somewhere to `<your_site_url>/feed.xml`. There, all done, but for more details see [the original github announcement](http://help.github.com/articles/atom-rss-feeds-for-github-pages).
